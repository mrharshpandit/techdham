        <p class="imaget"> Featues of Data Science</p>

        <div id="Types"> <h2>Types of Data in Data Science</h2>
            <p><strong style="font-weight: 545;">1. Structured Data:</strong>  
                Structured data is highly organized and easy to analyze. It is usually stored in tabular form, like in spreadsheets or databases. Each row represents a data entry, and each column represents a specific attribute. <strong style="font-weight: 545;">For example,</strong> in a table of customer data, rows may represent individual customers, while columns represent their name, age, address, and purchase history. Structured data is ideal for working with SQL databases.</p>
                
                <p><strong style="font-weight: 545;">2. Unstructured Data:</strong>  
                Unstructured data doesn’t follow a predefined format. This includes data like images, videos, social media posts, and emails. For instance, a photo or a video uploaded to a social media platform is unstructured data because it cannot be easily organized into rows and columns. Since this data is not in a structured format, it requires more advanced techniques to analyze, such as using machine learning or natural language processing.</p>
                
                <p><strong style="font-weight: 545;">3. Semi-Structured Data:</strong>  
                Semi-structured data is a mix between structured and unstructured data. It does not have a strict tabular format but still contains tags or markers that separate different elements of the data. An example of semi-structured data is a JSON or XML file. These files contain data in a hierarchy, but not every entry has to have the same structure, making it flexible yet somewhat organized.</p>
                
                <p><strong style="font-weight: 545;">4. Time-Series Data:</strong>  
                Time-series data is a type of structured data that tracks events or values over time. Examples include stock prices, weather data, or heart rate readings, where each value is associated with a specific timestamp. Analyzing this data can help identify trends or patterns over a period, such as the rise and fall of a company's stock over months or years.</p>
                
                <p><strong style="font-weight: 545;">5. Categorical Data:</strong>  
                Categorical data represents groups or categories and doesn’t have numerical value. Examples include gender (male, female), colors (red, green, blue), or product types (electronics, clothing, furniture). This type of data is typically used in classification models where labels are assigned to different data points.</p>
                
                <p><strong style="font-weight: 545;">6. Numerical Data:</strong>  
                Numerical data refers to data that is expressed in numbers and can be measured. It can be further divided into two types:
                <strong style="font-weight: 545;">- Discrete Data:</strong> Numbers that can only take specific values (e.g., number of students in a class).
                <strong style="font-weight: 545;">- Continuous Data:</strong> Numbers that can take any value within a range (e.g., height or temperature).
                Numerical data is used for mathematical and statistical calculations to derive insights.</p>

              <h2 id="dataprocess"> Data Process</h2>
              <p><strong style="font-weight: 545;">1. Data Collection:</strong>  
                The first step in the Data Science process is <strong style="font-weight: 545;">   gathering the data.</strong> This data can come from various sources like surveys, sensors, websites, or databases. For example, if you are analyzing sales performance, you might collect data from online sales records, customer feedback forms, and social media interactions. The goal here is to collect enough relevant data to work with.</p>
                
                <p><strong style="font-weight: 545;">2. Data Cleaning:</strong>  
                After collecting the data, the next step is to clean it. Raw data is often messy and incomplete, with missing or duplicate values. For example, if some customers didn’t fill out all the fields in a survey, or if some entries were recorded incorrectly, this data needs to be fixed. Cleaning data ensures it is consistent and ready for analysis, like removing unnecessary columns or fixing errors.</p>
                
                <p><strong style="font-weight: 545;">3. Data Exploration (EDA):</strong>  
                Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helps you understand the data better. This step involves visualizing and summarizing the data to find patterns, trends, or outliers. For example, you might create charts to see if there is a relationship between the amount customers spend and their age group. This helps you identify which variables are important for your analysis and guides the next steps.</p>
                
                <p><strong style="font-weight: 545;">4. Data Modeling:</strong>  
                In this step, you apply machine learning algorithms to create a model that can predict outcomes or classify data. For instance, if you want to predict future sales, you might use a linear regression model that analyzes past sales data. The model helps you understand how different factors affect your target variable, such as sales or customer behavior.</p>
                
                <p><strong style="font-weight: 545;">5. Model Evaluation:</strong>  
                After building the model, you need to test how well it works. You evaluate the model's performance using a separate set of data that the model hasn’t seen before. For example, if you built a model to predict house prices, you would test it on new data to see if the predicted prices match the actual prices. This helps you understand the model's accuracy and reliability.</p>
                
                <p><strong style="font-weight: 545;">6. Model Deployment:</strong>  
                Once you are satisfied with the model's performance, it’s time to deploy it for use. This means putting the model into action, so it can start making predictions or classifications on new data. For example, an e-commerce website might use a recommendation model to suggest products to customers based on their previous purchases. The model is integrated into the website to provide real-time recommendations.</p>
                
                <p><strong style="font-weight: 545;">7. Monitoring and Maintenance:</strong>  
                After deploying the model, it’s important to monitor its performance over time. Data changes, and models may need updates to maintain their accuracy. For example, if customer preferences change, the recommendation system might need to be adjusted to reflect new trends. This step ensures that the model remains effective in the long run.</p>
